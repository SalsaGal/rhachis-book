# Setting Up

To start using Rhachis, add these dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
glam = "0.22"
image = "0.24"
rhachis = "0.6"
```

If you wish to have access to more features of the engine that allow you to customise beyond the simple components, also add the following to the `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
wgpu = "0.14"
```
